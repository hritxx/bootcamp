# Reflection: Real-Time File Processing System

## Design Decisions

The architecture evolved from a simple text processor to a distributed, observable state engine. The most critical architectural decisions included:

1. **Tag-Based State Routing**: Moving from linear pipelines to a tag-based routing system provided tremendous flexibility. This allowed processing logic to be completely decoupled from flow control, enabling complex workflows without code changes.

2. **Stream-Based Processing**: Switching from `str -> str` functions to `Iterator[str] -> Iterator[str]` processors enabled stateful operations, fan-in/fan-out capabilities, and better resource management for large files.

3. **Concurrent Dashboard**: Running the metrics server on a separate thread kept the main processing path unblocked while providing real-time visibility into system state.

4. **Three-Directory Queue Pattern**: The unprocessed/underprocess/processed folder structure provided durability and clear visual indication of file state, while enabling automatic recovery on restart.

The most valuable abstraction was the state engine with its tagged line routing. This single architecture supported everything from simple transformations to complex conditional flows, all defined in configuration rather than code.

## Tradeoffs

To keep the implementation manageable, I made several simplifications:

1. **Single-Machine Focus**: The system runs on a single machine rather than distributing work across a cluster.

2. **File-Level Atomicity**: Files are processed entirely or not at all - there's no partial retry or checkpointing within files.

3. **In-Memory Metrics**: System metrics and traces are kept in memory rather than persisted, limiting historical analysis.

4. **Limited Error Handling**: While the system recovers from crashes, it lacks sophisticated error classification and progressive retry policies.

The current limitations include throughput constraints (single-threaded processing), weak schema validation, and lack of security features for multi-user environments.

## Scalability

To handle 100x larger input volumes, I would implement:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple files concurrently using a worker pool.

2. **Stream Chunking**: Split large files into manageable chunks that can be processed independently.

3. **Distributed Architecture**: Move from a single machine to multiple nodes, using a distributed queue (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) instead of a folder-based approach.

4. **Persistent Metrics Store**: Replace in-memory metrics with a time-series database like Prometheus.

5. **Checkpointing**: Add line-level recovery so partially processed files can resume from their last good state.

## Extensibility & Security

To productionize this system for real users, I would add:

1. **Authentication**: Add OAuth/JWT authentication for API access and file uploads.

2. **Authorization**: Implement role-based permissions for different operations.

3. **Input Validation**: Add schema validation to reject malformed data before processing.

4. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.

5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent DoS attacks by limiting upload rates.

6. **Audit Logging**: Track all operations for compliance and troubleshooting.

7. **Plugin System**: Create a proper plugin architecture for processor extensions.

8. **Multi-tenancy**: Isolate processing between different users or teams.

The current design provides a solid foundation, but these enhancements would make it truly production-ready for enterprise use.
