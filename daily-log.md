# Bootcamp Learning Journey

## Days 0-1: Python Fundamentals & Documentation

### Python Packaging
- Created my first Python package "hriteek-hello" with proper structure
- Set up project configuration using pyproject.toml
- Created a Todo CLI app with JSON-based storage
- Used modern dependency management with uv

### CLI Development
- Implemented CLI applications using Typer
- Added rich text formatting with the Rich library
- Built argument parsing systems with argparse
- Created interactive command-line interfaces

### Documentation
- Learned Markdown syntax and formatting
- Set up MkDocs with Material theme
- Created comprehensive documentation with badges and examples
- Developed structured documentation principles

## Day 2: Python Advanced Concepts

### Modular Python Development
- Created reusable Python libraries
- Built applications that leverage external packages
- Practiced cross-package module reuse
- Published packages to dev-PyPI

### Configuration Management
- Implemented hierarchical config lookup with YAML
- Used environment variables for configuration
- Created default configurations that ship with packages
- Built flexible configuration systems

### Logging & Observability
- Added proper Python logging to projects
- Created configurable logging levels
- Implemented context-based logging
- Used decorators for function tracing
- Built health check and resource monitoring systems

## Day 3: Abstraction Evolution

### Level 1: Basic Parameterization
- Organized code into functions with specific responsibilities
- Configured applications via environment variables
- Built a command-line interface with Typer
- Implemented simple text processing functions

### Level 2: Modular Architecture
- Separated concerns across multiple modules
- Created pipeline architecture with str → str processors
- Added type definitions for better code clarity
- Implemented dynamic processor selection

### Level 3: Dynamic Configuration
- Built YAML-based pipeline configuration
- Implemented dynamic module loading with importlib
- Created organized package structures
- Fully decoupled processing logic from code

### Level 4: Stream Processing
- Evolved to Iterator[str] → Iterator[str] processors
- Implemented stateful operations (counters, buffers)
- Built fan-in/fan-out capabilities
- Created adapters for backward compatibility

### Level 5: DAG-Based Routing
- Implemented dynamic routing through processor nodes
- Created tag-based flow control
- Built configurable graph structures with YAML
- Supported conditional processing paths

### Level 6: State-Based Routing
- Built a general-purpose state transition engine
- Implemented tag-based processing flow
- Supported complex workflows including loops
- Decoupled routing logic from processor implementation

### Level 7: Observability
- Implemented real-time metrics collection
- Added execution tracing for debugging
- Built a FastAPI-based dashboard on separate thread
- Created system performance monitoring

### Level 8: Automated Processing
- Built continuous folder monitoring for new files
- Implemented three-directory queue pattern
- Added automatic recovery after system crashes
- Created a live dashboard for processing state

### Level 9: Production-Ready System
- Implemented dual execution modes (one-shot and watch)
- Added Docker containerization
- Created file upload via HTTP and rsync
- Developed comprehensive documentation and deployment guides

## Day 4: System Architecture & Design

### Key Architectural Patterns
- Tag-based routing for flexible processing paths
- Stream-based processing for efficient handling of large files
- Observable state management for real-time insight
- Fault-tolerance patterns for recovery
- Configurable pipelines for workflow flexibility

### System Design Considerations
- Decoupling configuration from implementation
- Stream processing for resource management
- State tracking for complex workflows
- Observability for operational systems
- Resilience patterns using folder-based queues

### Production Readiness
- Authentication and authorization concepts
- Input validation and security considerations
- Scaling strategies for high-volume processing
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Multi-tenancy design approaches
