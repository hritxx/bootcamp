# Developer Documentation Bootcamp - Day 1

Welcome to my documentation bootcamp journey! This is where I'm learning to create effective technical documentation as a software developer. It's only day 1, and I'm excited to build this knowledge base as I progress through the program.

## What I'm Learning

By the end of this bootcamp, I should be able to:

- Write clear and purposeful documentation using Markdown
- Create visual diagrams to communicate complex processes
- Design and structure documentation properly
- Publish documentation using MkDocs
- Develop good documentation habits

## Today's Progress

Today I set up my documentation environment:

- Installed MkDocs and the Material theme
- Configured my documentation site
- Learned Markdown basics
- Started creating my first pages

## Modules to Explore

1. [Markdown Essentials](markdown/introduction.md)
2. [Visual Thinking Tools](diagrams/sequence-diagrams.md)
3. [MkDocs + Material Theme](tools/mkdocs.md)
4. [Documentation Best Practices](design/design-docs.md)

## My Learning Goals

For this bootcamp, I aim to:

- Master Markdown syntax
- Get comfortable with documentation tools
- Create clear, useful documentation for my projects
- Build documentation as a habit, not an afterthought

I'll update this site daily as I learn new concepts and techniques!
